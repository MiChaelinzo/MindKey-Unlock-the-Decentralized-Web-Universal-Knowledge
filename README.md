## Getting started with the server-side:

```sh
# Go to https://infura.io/ and get your XRP API key.
# It looks like this: 
# https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/3fe7c90a4ec34aae900a7900d3fb48dc
# You can use mine for test, but it's free so please create your own at https://infura.io/
# Put your key in 'src/config.json' under 'RippleNetwork'
```

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

```sh
# Start developing
npm run dev
```

```sh
# Start production server
npm start
```

### Config

```js
{
  "port": 8080, // port to launch app to
  "bodyLimit": "1kb", // max size of request json object
  "RippleNetwork": "" // Infura API key
}
```

## Endpoints

`/createWallet`

```sh
GET localhost:8080/createWallet
```

```js
# response
{
  "address": CREATED_WALLET,
  "privateKey": PRIVATE_KEY
}
```

`/getBalance/SOME_XRP_ADDRESS`

```sh
GET localhost:8080/getBalance/SOME_XRP_ADDRESS
```

```js
# response
{
  "XRPAddress": SOME_XRP_ADDRESS,
  "balance": BALANCE
}
```

`/transaction`

```sh
POST to localhost:8080/transaction
BODY
{
	"privateKey": YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY,
	"amount": AMOUNT,
	"destination": DESTINATION_WALLET
}
```

```js
# response
{
  "txHash": TRANSACTION_HASH
}
```
## Getting started with the client:

As a client we are using NFC Tools Pro to program and write the wallet "app" on the NFC chip.

The "app" has 25 tasks and total 828 bytes.

```sh
# Download 'XRP_profile.json' and save it on your phone somewhere.

# This file is the main app file needed.
```

```sh

## Security tips
- Whitelisting your nfc chip
- Using password encrypted private key (soon)
- Using SSL to communicate to app

We configured app to work on Rinkeby test net, so itâ€™s safe to play with.

If you want to use it on Mainnet, just get that Infura API mainet end-point, and 
copy it to your 'src/config.json' file.
